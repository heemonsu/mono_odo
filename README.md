Monocular Odometry

WORK IN PROGRESS

Monocular odometry pipeline based on 3d-2d correspondance, with bundle adjustement and loop closure.
Implemented in C++ with OpenCV, g2o and DLoopDetector

PRESENT GOAL

1/ Get reasonable odometry results from 3d-2d correspondances

TODO

2/ Add bundle adjustement with g2o
3/ Add loop closure with DLoopDetector
